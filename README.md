#### Halwai Aftab Hasan
- Organised and attended Mumbai Meetup to have amazing discussions with fellow scholars

![image7](https://github.com/Polarbeargo/Secure-Private-AI-Facebook-Scholarship-KeyStone-project/blob/master/images/Meetuppic1.jpg)

**$Summarized all ideas and initiatives as outcome of today's meetup$**

**SPAIC Mumbai Meetup - 29-06-19**

**Local Meetup**

To be planned every two/three weeks
5 members from Mumbai could join for organizing this activity
Time, location, agenda, activities to be decided for each meetup
Location should be such that we can have technical discussion as well as host virtual meetup for members who cannot join personally (we faced this issue today)
Organiser could conduct activities and agenda could be like discussion on one topic from course, recent initiatives by members, time based fun games related to course,etc 

**Virtual meetup**

To be planned every  week
3 members from Mumbai could join for organizing this activity
Time, location, agenda, activities to be decided for each meetup
Organiser could conduct activities and agenda could be like discussion on one topic from course, recent initiatives by members, time based fun games related to course,etc 

**Trello board for all mumbai meetup activities**

We are planning to create a trello board for listing for task done by mumbai Members as there is no specific channel. This may help us to be aware of all activities at one place and we can share screenshot of this list in 60dayofudacity

**Study buddy groups**

Idea is to start study buddy group for all mumbai members which will help all of us with course completion, learning and participate in this challenge actively.
2 members from mumbai can pair up with each other and search 2 members from slack (who are not in mumbai) for studying together. 
Apart from course lessons, they could get involved in some project, activities/topic discussion/sessions that can be shared during mumbai meetups (Definitely we will have only mumbai members for local meetups so they can share their work as a representative from their group). 
Each group task/initiative will be managed using trello boards so that others can give suggestions or join any task they are interested into.

**Initiatives**

Apart from the above activities, it would be good if we take part in slack initiatives already in progress or new initiatives we can think during meetup or slack channel to have a better learning and been active.


**Above initiatives are just a suggestion and we would need your input/feedback/ideas from all of you.**

and because of @Bearbear I can't be here :) so thxs a lot :) 

PollyAPP [9:32 PM]

we Both me and @cibaca planning for this initiative, lets me know yours thoughts

Week wise Study on particular chapter from 2 courses, Every week we work on particular chapter from each courses
courses like SPAIF or Intro  to deeplearning with pytorch

example

week 1:- (7 - 14 july)

1) Introduction to Neural Network

2) Deeplearning with pytorch

similarly

week 2 - (14 - 21 july)
...
...
...
week 7 - (18 - 25 Aug)

1) security federated learning

2) Encrypted Deeplearning


*Plan to execute in week*

- choose study partner
- spend 1 hour a day
- chapter base project u have complete every week so that it will help in practical experiences
- research paper (required provided regarding chapter base)
- we will work @Arka project which is going on kaggle so that we will learn a lot, how he uses research paper and all to improve accuracy and many things.

Advantage :

1) easy learning
2) implement learning of outsider and learning skill of them, how they work


i want everyone should complete something by the end of this courses or something u achieve :slightly_smiling_face:"

Day start with kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification i thought lets work with transfer learning and here we with kaggle master @Bearbear help me use to a different type of model 

* #sg_mumbai End the study plan poll with 17 people who agrees to start initiative without any disagree, its was a great result for me :slightly_smiling_face: 
* Kaggle kernel fork issue solved by @Bearbear thxs a lot :slightly_smiling_face: 
* start reading other kernels and discussion of https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification
which help me for create a upgrade version than Alexander Milekhin and Hsin Wen Chang @Bearbear.
* Attended Virtual Meetup with @Bearbear, and her vision regarding helping udacity community :slightly_smiling_face: 
* then i use AlexNet, VGG-19 with batch normalization, ResNet-152, SqueezeNet 1.1, Densenet-201 and i found 100 % Accuracy with 149 rank:slightly_smiling_face: in  https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification :slightly_smiling_face: :slightly_smiling_face:

#### Sarah
* Started planning out my kestone project.  I would like to use the [tutorial](https://blog.openmined.org/federated-learning-of-a-rnn-on-raspberry-pis/) on OpenMined for federated learning on raspberry pis as a base and build on that.  Unfortunately, I will have to wait to start that until I am a little further into my Geology course.  It started today and I need to write a discussion post on it Wednesday.  That class should ease up in a couple weeks when I get into it and can do much of the reading on weekends.

### Day 13:

* Rewatching lecture Introducing local and global Differential Privacy.
* Continue learning, watching and implement fastai https://www.fast.ai/.

Continue learning writing a research paper explain MCL vs EKF using LATEX finished Introduction section and roughly completed abstract start writing background section and feel this writing research paper experience will help me build deeper knowledge in AMCL and EKF.
* Reading, Watching and implementing Robotic Software Engineer Nanodegree program lectures and quizzes to lesson 17.11 Grid-based FastSLAM Techniques.
* Reading and watching AI for trading Nanodegree program to lesson 14 Pairs Trading and mean reversion refresh my memory about z score feel happy and feel that I want to read lesson 13 volatility and lesson 14 Pairs Trading and mean reversion again because it is truly excellent, remarkable and fun! I saw wales in the lesson:D! Start Reading project Breakout Strategy.

* Back to my mini project federated learning with the help of my team, i started https://github.com/OpenMined/AndroidWorker in android studio.
* I initialize this androidworker by clone it to my pc and then open in androidstudio.
* So its my 1st interaction with android studio and its start with error and some pc hanging due to ram, but any how i manage to keep moving on by solving issue one by one.
* I still working on federated learning mini project with my team @Bearbear @Harkirat @Sarah Majors.

### Day 32: 

#### Polarbeargo

* Rewatching lesson 7 Federated learning for 30 min.
* Modified AI for trading Nanodegree program Breakout Strategy Project follow reviewer's advice learn that we need to find outliers that satisfy both thresholds(ks_threshold and pvalue_threshold) at the same time. The outliers satisfying both thresholds at the same time would be a lot lesser. Finally passed this project but feel needs rewatching and spend some time thinking about the lessons.
* Finished native ROS package installation continue implementing Robotic Software Engineer Nanodegree program project where am I. Today is my first day finished design my own robot model with Gazebo and named it Hsin_bot which imitates the rocket, I'm so happy:) as I saw Hsin_bot moving a little bit forward! Continue to debug request for map failed in native ROS.
