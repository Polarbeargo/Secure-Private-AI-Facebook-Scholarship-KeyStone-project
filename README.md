#### Halwai Aftab Hasan
- Organised and attended Mumbai Meetup to have amazing discussions with fellow scholars

![image7](https://github.com/Polarbeargo/Secure-Private-AI-Facebook-Scholarship-KeyStone-project/blob/master/images/Meetuppic1.jpg)

**$Summarized all ideas and initiatives as outcome of today's meetup$**

**SPAIC Mumbai Meetup - 29-06-19**

**Local Meetup**

To be planned every two/three weeks
5 members from Mumbai could join for organizing this activity
Time, location, agenda, activities to be decided for each meetup
Location should be such that we can have technical discussion as well as host virtual meetup for members who cannot join personally (we faced this issue today)
Organiser could conduct activities and agenda could be like discussion on one topic from course, recent initiatives by members, time based fun games related to course,etc 

**Virtual meetup**

To be planned every  week
3 members from Mumbai could join for organizing this activity
Time, location, agenda, activities to be decided for each meetup
Organiser could conduct activities and agenda could be like discussion on one topic from course, recent initiatives by members, time based fun games related to course,etc 

**Trello board for all mumbai meetup activities**

We are planning to create a trello board for listing for task done by mumbai Members as there is no specific channel. This may help us to be aware of all activities at one place and we can share screenshot of this list in 60dayofudacity

**Study buddy groups**

Idea is to start study buddy group for all mumbai members which will help all of us with course completion, learning and participate in this challenge actively.
2 members from mumbai can pair up with each other and search 2 members from slack (who are not in mumbai) for studying together. 
Apart from course lessons, they could get involved in some project, activities/topic discussion/sessions that can be shared during mumbai meetups (Definitely we will have only mumbai members for local meetups so they can share their work as a representative from their group). 
Each group task/initiative will be managed using trello boards so that others can give suggestions or join any task they are interested into.

**Initiatives**

Apart from the above activities, it would be good if we take part in slack initiatives already in progress or new initiatives we can think during meetup or slack channel to have a better learning and been active.


**Above initiatives are just a suggestion and we would need your input/feedback/ideas from all of you.**

PollyAPP [9:32 PM]

we Both me and @cibaca planning for this initiative, lets me know yours thoughts

Week wise Study on particular chapter from 2 courses, Every week we work on particular chapter from each courses
courses like SPAIF or Intro  to deeplearning with pytorch

example

week 1:- (7 - 14 july)

1) Introduction to Neural Network

2) Deeplearning with pytorch

similarly

week 2 - (14 - 21 july)
...
...
...
week 7 - (18 - 25 Aug)

1) security federated learning

2) Encrypted Deeplearning


*Plan to execute in week*

- choose study partner
- spend 1 hour a day
- chapter base project u have complete every week so that it will help in practical experiences
- research paper (required provided regarding chapter base)
- we will work @Arka project which is going on kaggle so that we will learn a lot, how he uses research paper and all to improve accuracy and many things.

Advantage :

1) easy learning
2) implement learning of outsider and learning skill of them, how they work


i want everyone should complete something by the end of this courses or something u achieve :slightly_smiling_face:"

#### Sarah
* Started planning out my kestone project.  I would like to use the [tutorial](https://blog.openmined.org/federated-learning-of-a-rnn-on-raspberry-pis/) on OpenMined for federated learning on raspberry pis as a base and build on that.  Unfortunately, I will have to wait to start that until I am a little further into my Geology course.  It started today and I need to write a discussion post on it Wednesday.  That class should ease up in a couple weeks when I get into it and can do much of the reading on weekends.

#### Halwai Aftab Hasan

* Still working on Differential privacy project on MNIST dataset by the help of https://github.com/dashitoishi23/PATE-Analysis-on-DL-Models/blob/master/PATE_Analysis_on_Deep_Learning_Models.ipynb
*  Reading [The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf)
* Soon i will create a respo on differential privacy only
* Start with Federated Learning 7.1, 7.2 , 7.3 and 70% course is completed :)

i admire and get lots of inspiration from @Bearbear and her vision for AI community is increadible, and its a great opportunity for me to learn something under her and like she is doing , i also dominating like her :)  

#### Sarah
* Read a few more pages of Deep Learning 5.5 - going slowly.  I'll get through chapter 5 some day

### Day 16: 

#### Polarbeargo

* Still rereading lecture Introducing local and global Differential Privacy to 5.6 Varying amounts of noise - 5.8 Create a Differentially Private Query amounts.
* Reading AI for Trading Nanodegree Program to lesson 5.8 Survivor Bias.
* Organizing paper references from nanodegree programs into a repository start from Aftab ask me question about he want to read more papers relate to Artificial Intelligence and neural network and I know from my heart that it's time to organizing and right thing to do to help classmates for their future path. Share this repository to all Scholarship classmates and CS50 study group by this Friday https://github.com/Polarbeargo/The-love-I-receive-from-Udacity-reviewer-resources/blob/master/README.md.

#### Halwai Aftab Hasan

* Complete Lesson 7 - Federated Learning and overall all 80% completion 
* watched how federated Learning work on cell phones https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbRJPa9d-VU
* watched Google I/O on federated Learning https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89BGjQYA0uE
* poster story of federated learning by google https://federated.withgoogle.com/
* Real world project on Pysyft Android given by @sarah or @Bearbear thxs a lot for that https://towardsdatascience.com/pysyft-android-b28da47a767e
* one more project by @Bearbear https://blog.openmined.org/federated-learning-of-a-rnn-on-raspberry-pis/

I Encourage new Mumbai members @Diksha Verma @falconArrow
big shout out for #sg_mumbai
#60daysofudacity

#### Sarah
* Coordinated with the t-shirt project planning committee to create a video to lauch the competition officially.  It covers the scope, purpose and deadlines of the competition as well as walks through a GAN notebook to help people get started.

### Day 17: 

#### Polarbeargo

i already knew that today is my hectic day and its happened 
- Day start with Hackathon organize by #sg_hackathon-orgnizrs team which many scholars participate in this 2 days of hackathon 
so my team name is Hasan & Hasan and teammates are @cibaca @Shivam Raisharma @Hitoishi Das so big shout out to #sg_hackathon-orgnizrs https://www.kaggle.com/spaics/datasets
- Reading application and articles on federated learning for the presenation in front of my team @Bearbear @Sarah Majors @Harkirat 
and preparing on this statement " I m thinking about what if we choose a real world project by using this course its help for the society and community as well "

- Team Second Virtual Meetup held by Time IST 7PM OR TAIWAN 9.30 PM OR USA 9.30 AM 
we start with talking about federated learning then we move to real world project on federated learning on pysyft android https://towardsdatascience.com/pysyft-android-b28da47a767e by the guidences of @Bearbear and create a respo for that as well.
